#[22,27,16,2,18,6] we use Insertion Sort
#FÄ±rstly find the smallest number and swap each other.
#2 is the smallest so our new lis t --> [2,27,16,22,18,6]
#Find other smallest number except 2 and replace
#6 is this number so --> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
#Countiune like that --> [2,6,16,22,18,27]
#[2,6,16,18,22,27] And we got the solution.
